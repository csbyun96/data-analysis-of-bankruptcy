# Data Analysis of Bankruptcy with R


Three methods can be used to determine if companies go bankrupt based on 10 predictors: logistic regression, lassoregcv, and decision trees. Logistic regression helps to understand the relationship between predictors and bankruptcy, and its accuracy can be measured using AUC. Lassoregcv encourages sparse models and selects the optimal regularization parameter. Decision trees build a model of decisions and consequences to determine important predictors. These methods provide a comprehensive understanding of bankruptcy factors.
